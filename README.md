# AirMix PC

AirMix PC is a GPLv3 Windows tray receiver that brings iPhone audio to the
current Windows default output over AirPlay/Wi-Fi. Windows mixes that stream
with PC audio, so both are heard through devices such as the WH-1000XM6.

Version 1 is intentionally audio-only (`-vs 0`): screen mirroring, video and
FairPlay DRM playback are outside its scope. It uses `wasapi2sink` in shared
mode and follows the Windows default endpoint. Auto mode starts with a 0.5 s
buffer and promotes the next controlled AirPlay connection to Stable (2 s)
after repeated packet loss, late packets, buffer flushes, or disconnects.

Settings, pairing state, private key, and rotating logs live under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\AirMixPC`. The installer restricts that directory to the
current user and SYSTEM, creates Private-network-only program firewall rules,
and marks the known `admin_new` and `admin_new_5g` profiles Private.

Build from an MSYS2 MinGW64 shell with `./build.sh`, then compile the normal
Windows installer with `installer\build-installer.ps1`. Run
`dist\installer\AirMixPC-Setup-1.1.0.exe` to install. The modern wizard offers
Ukrainian and English UI, startup and desktop-shortcut choices, and caches a
repair launcher in the Start menu. Windows Installed Apps provides normal
uninstall. Uninstall does not touch Bluetooth Audio Receiver, Phone Link, or
device drivers, and preserves AirMix pairing/settings.

## Multiple Devices

AirMix PC can accept more than one Apple device at the same time under the
single receiver name `AirMix PC`. Each connecting device gets its own
GStreamer pipeline and its own `wasapi2sink` in shared mode; Windows mixes
all of those streams (and any other PC audio) before they reach the output
device. The number of devices allowed at once is controlled by `maxClients`
in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AirMixPC\settings.json`, defaulting to 4 with a valid
range of 1-12. Twelve is the underlying connection-slot limit; in practice
keeping it at 4 or lower is more realistic for a shared Windows audio
endpoint.

Streams from different devices are **not** synchronized with each other —
each is treated as an independent source, which is fine for mixing separate
audio but not suitable for two devices playing the same song in unison.
Changing the latency mode or the Windows default output restarts the
receiver core and disconnects every connected device. AirPlay volume is
tracked per device, while the overall output volume stays a single, shared
Windows setting. Losing the connection to one device only ends that
device's session; the others keep playing. The tray window and menu list
every currently connected device.

## Upstream project notes

**A lightweight, audio-only, Bonjour-free UxPlay distribution for Windows.**

UxPlayEnhanced turns a Windows PC into an AirPlay audio receiver without
installing Apple's Bonjour service. It is built on the official
[FDH2/UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay) project and keeps UxPlay's audio
engine while making the packaged Windows experience intentionally audio-first:
no local video renderer, no always-open terminal, and no external mDNS service.

> Upstream: [FDH2/UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay). The upstream source
> is tracked directly in this repository as the `lib/uxplay` Git submodule.
> UxPlayEnhanced is an independent Windows packaging and integration project,
> not an official FDH2 release.

## What UxPlayEnhanced Changes

| Area | UxPlayEnhanced behavior |
|---|---|
| Primary use | AirPlay audio playback on Windows |
| Video pipeline | Disabled by default with `-vs 0` |
| Device discovery | Embedded mDNS; Apple Bonjour is not required |
| User interface | Background tray application with status, song, quality, and logs |
| Installation | Self-elevating setup creates firewall rules and shortcuts |
| Audio information | Logs codec, lossless/lossy classification, and receiver format |
| Console noise | Suppresses repeated unchanged metadata blocks |
| ALAC startup | Begins dequeuing on the first real audio packet to avoid a startup burst |
| Windows resampling | Uses GStreamer's maximum quality for 44.1 to 48 kHz conversion |

“Lightweight” refers to runtime behavior: the normal launcher does not create a
video decode/render pipeline and does not require a separate Bonjour service.
The release still includes the GStreamer and FFmpeg libraries required by
UxPlay's audio stack.

## Install

1. Download the latest Windows ZIP from the
   [UxPlayEnhanced releases](https://github.com/Kylepossible/UxPlayEnhanced/releases).
2. Extract the complete ZIP.
3. Run `UxPlayEnhanced-Setup.cmd`.
4. Approve the Windows administrator prompt.
5. Launch **UxPlayEnhanced** from the desktop or Start menu.
6. Open the AirPlay output selector on the iPhone, iPad, or Mac and choose the
   Windows computer's name.

The setup installs to `C:\Program Files\UxPlayEnhanced`, unblocks files that
inherited Windows' downloaded-file marker, creates and verifies program-scoped
inbound TCP and UDP firewall rules used by AirPlay, adds desktop and Start-menu
shortcuts, and registers an uninstall entry in Windows Apps and Features.

The desktop shortcut is created in the Windows all-users Desktop so it remains
visible when setup is approved with a different administrator account. Setup
verifies that the shortcut targets the installed copy before reporting success.
The installer does not delete the extracted release folder; its setup files are
intentionally not copied into Program Files. After a successful installation,
the extracted folder can be deleted manually.

During an upgrade, setup stops every running executable from the installed
package and waits until the installation stays process-free. Releases use a
versioned application directory so antivirus behavior monitoring cannot strand
an upgrade by protecting an older executable. Hash-identical runtime files are
retained instead of being overwritten, while copied files receive SHA-256
verification.

Uninstall from Windows **Apps and Features**. The uninstaller verifies the
registered Program Files path before recursive removal. If antivirus behavior
monitoring keeps an old runtime file protected, uninstall schedules only the
remaining UxPlayEnhanced files for deletion at the next Windows restart and
reports that a restart is required.

### Portable Use

Installation is optional. Extract the ZIP and run `setup-firewall.ps1` once; it
requests administrator access automatically. Then launch `UxPlayEnhanced.bat`.
The portable launcher also starts in audio-only mode and uses the tray
application when available.

## Tray Application

The bundled `UxPlayEnhanced.exe` runs UxPlay without an open terminal window.
Right-click its blue tray icon to see:

- AirPlay host, connected client device, and connection status
- Current artist, song, and album metadata
- Clean codec, lossless/lossy quality, bit depth, sample rate, and channels
- View logs and open the installation folder
- Restart and quit controls

Logs are stored at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\UxPlayEnhanced\Logs\UxPlayEnhanced.log`. **View logs** opens
that file directly in Notepad, without relying on a Windows `.log` file
association. The log rotates at 5 MB and keeps two older files
(`UxPlayEnhanced.log.1` and `.log.2`), so a long-running receiver cannot fill
the disk.

Normal logs omit the once-per-second track progress display. Launch
`UxPlayEnhanced.exe --verbose` when troubleshooting to include those progress
updates; connection, format, metadata, warning, and error events are always
logged.

The executable bundles its Python runtime and tray dependencies. End users do
not need Python, `pip`, `pystray`, or Pillow installed.

Only one tray receiver runs per Windows session, including across portable and
installed copies. Opening it again leaves the existing receiver running. Tray
status clears when the audio session ends, and each metadata block replaces the
previous song's fields.

Quit and Restart request normal receiver shutdown, closing AirPlay connections
and sending mDNS goodbye records. The receiver also watches the tray process
and shuts down if it disappears, instead of leaving an orphan receiver running.
A hung receiver is forcibly stopped only after the graceful-shutdown timeout.

## Audio-Only Behavior

All included launchers pass `-vs 0`, which disables UxPlay's local video sink.
This avoids local video decoding, rendering, and video-timing work while keeping
AirPlay audio reception active. The underlying `uxplay.exe` remains available
for advanced users, but screen mirroring is outside this distribution's normal
supported workflow. Use upstream [FDH2/UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay)
when full video-mirroring behavior is the priority.

## Audio Format Logging

When an audio session starts, UxPlayEnhanced logs the codec, lossless/lossy
classification, receiver resolution, channel count, and equivalent decoded PCM
bitrate. `ALAC` (`ct=2`) is lossless and `AAC-ELD` (`ct=8`) is lossy.

The current receiver profile is 16-bit/44.1 kHz. The log therefore reports the
format received and decoded by UxPlay; it does not claim to measure the source
service's encoded bitrate or prove that an Apple Music source was Hi-Res
Lossless. Repeated identical DMAP metadata updates are omitted from the console.

In Apple Music terms, UxPlayEnhanced's 16-bit/44.1 kHz receiver profile is
standard **Lossless** (CD quality), not **Hi-Res Lossless**; see
[Apple's lossless-audio guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/play-lossless-audio-iph14e213417/26/ios/26).
This is also the useful compatibility default for iOS 27 Developer Beta 3:
[current beta user reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOS27/comments/1uwsphr/apple_music_automix_on_ios_27_public_beta/)
indicate AutoMix works with Lossless selected but is unavailable with Hi-Res
Lossless. Apple does not list that restriction in the
[Beta 3 release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-27-release-notes),
so it should be treated as beta behavior that may change.

ALAC playback starts from the first real audio payload instead of accumulating
frames until the first NTP synchronization packet and then burst-draining them.
This is a narrowed backport of
[FDH2/UxPlay PR #548](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/pull/548); malformed short
packets are excluded explicitly. The PR's separate `audioresample quality=10`
change was evaluated independently: it added approximately 2.18 ms of filter
latency and increased this isolated stage from about 0.11% to 0.22% of one CPU
core on the build PC. UxPlayEnhanced includes it because the absolute overhead
is small and audio quality is the project's priority.

## Bonjour-Free Discovery

UxPlayEnhanced replaces UxPlay's Windows Bonjour/DNS-SD dependency with the
embedded responder in `src/dnssd_embedded.c`. It:

- Listens for mDNS on UDP multicast `224.0.0.251:5353`
- Advertises `_airplay._tcp` and `_raop._tcp`
- Responds with PTR, SRV, TXT, and A records
- Sends startup announcements and TTL=0 goodbye records
- Runs in-process without `dnssd.dll`, iTunes, iCloud, or Bonjour services

Discovery is advertised only on active IPv4 interfaces that have an IPv4
gateway; PPP, tunnel, and no-multicast adapters (including VPN TAP
interfaces such as WatchGuard Mobile VPN) are skipped so AirPlay traffic
stays on the routed home LAN. Each qualifying interface advertises its own
address. The interface list is rechecked every 15 seconds, so joining
Wi-Fi, docking, or a network change is picked up without a restart, and an
unsolicited announcement of active services is repeated every 30 seconds so
a browsing client that missed the initial announcement still finds the
receiver.

## Build from Source

Clone this repository with its official UxPlay submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Kylepossible/UxPlayEnhanced.git
cd UxPlayEnhanced
```

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), then install the MinGW64 build
dependencies:

```bash
pacman -S --needed \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-gstreamer \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-base \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-good \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-bad \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-libav \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-libplist \
  mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config
```

The standalone tray executable also requires a Windows Python build environment
with PyInstaller, `pystray`, and Pillow. Run the build from MSYS2:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The self-contained package is written to `dist/UxPlayEnhanced/`.

Packaging fails if the tray, required plugins, or runtime DLLs are missing.
The build uses `pefile` (included with Windows PyInstaller) to inspect normal
and delayed DLL imports, resolving third-party dependencies from MinGW instead
of assuming that libraries found on the build PC are available to users.

Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` for tray and package tests.
`tests/test_installer.ps1 -PackageDir <extracted-package> -ResultPath <results.json>`
is an elevated Windows PowerShell 5.1 integration test: it deliberately creates
duplicate legacy rules, runs portable setup twice, installs/repairs v1.1.1 twice,
and checks installed hashes, the desktop shortcut, and firewall targets. Run it
only on a Windows machine where installing the test release is intended.
Setting `UXPLAYENHANCED_TEST_PACKAGE` to a built package directory enables two
additional receiver tests: normal shutdown with a live control socket and
captured mDNS goodbye, and cleanup after its parent process is terminated.

UxPlayEnhanced builds on [FDH2/UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay), which is
licensed under GPL-3.0, and every release ships a patched `uxplay.exe`. A
modified GPLv3 work must itself be distributed under GPLv3, so that license
covers this repository and all binary releases.

Per-component notes:

| Component | License |
|---|---|
| `lib/uxplay/` (submodule) | GPL-3.0 — see [lib/uxplay/LICENSE](lib/uxplay/LICENSE) |
| `lib/uxplay/lib/` (upstream AirPlay library, derived from RPiPlay/shairplay) | LGPL-2.1-or-later |
| `src/dnssd_embedded.c` | LGPL-2.1-or-later, matching the upstream `lib/dnssd.c` it replaces |
| `src/audio_renderer.c`, `src/audio_renderer.h` | GPL-3.0 — modified upstream `renderers/audio_renderer.c` (RPiPlay/UxPlay) |
| `patch_cmake.py`, `build.sh`, `launcher/` | GPL-3.0 |

`src/dnssd_embedded.c` stays under LGPL-2.1-or-later so it remains usable in the
same places upstream's `lib/dnssd.c` is; the "or later" grant makes it
compatible with the GPL-3.0 work it links into. `src/audio_renderer.c` and
`src/audio_renderer.h` are a full file replacement of UxPlay's
`renderers/audio_renderer.c`/`.h`, adding per-session pipelines for multiple
connected devices; `build.sh` copies both into `lib/uxplay/renderers/` before
the build, the same way it does for `dnssd_embedded.c`.

The complete corresponding source for a binary release is this repository at the
matching tag, together with the `lib/uxplay` submodule commit it pins.
